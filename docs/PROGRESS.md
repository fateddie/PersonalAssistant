### 🔄 In Progress (5%)

#### End-to-End Integration
- [ ] Connect Streamlit UI to FastAPI backend
- [ ] Real-time message processing
- [ ] Display API responses in chat
- [ ] Test complete user workflow

**Why this matters:**
Right now, the frontend and backend work independently. We need to wire them together so when you type in the chat, it actually calls the backend API and shows you real responses.

**What's needed:**
1. Add HTTP client to Streamlit (using `requests` or `httpx`)
2. Wire button click to API call
3. Display formatted responses
4. Handle errors gracefully
5. Test the full flow

## 💪 Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Module Organization
**Problem:** How to keep modules independent?
**Solution:** Event bus architecture - modules never import each other

### Challenge 2: Testing Frontend
**Problem:** How to catch UI breakages automatically?
**Solution:** Playwright with visual regression testing

### Challenge 3: Complex Setup
**Problem:** Too many manual steps to get started
**Solution:** One script `./scripts/setup.sh` does everything

### Challenge 4: Lost Context Between Sessions
**Problem:** Hard to remember what was done
**Solution:** Comprehensive documentation + progress tracking

---

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Event bus architecture** - Made adding modules trivial
2. **Test-first approach** - Caught bugs early
3. **Comprehensive automation** - Saved hours of manual work
4. **Visual regression** - Would have missed UI bugs otherwise
5. **Clear milestones** - Always knew what to do next

### What We'd Do Differently
1. **Earlier integration testing** - Would have caught connection issues sooner
2. **More frequent commits** - Better history for rollbacks
3. **Baseline creation earlier** - Would have visual history from start

### Key Takeaways
- Automation pays off immediately
- Good documentation speeds up development
- Testing gives confidence to refactor
- Clear architecture makes everything easier

---

## 🎉 Celebration Points

- ✅ **Milestone 1:** First script executed successfully
- ✅ **Milestone 2:** All modules loaded without errors
- ✅ **Milestone 3:** First API call returned data
- ✅ **Milestone 4:** Frontend UI rendered
- ✅ **Milestone 5:** All tests passing
- ✅ **Milestone 6:** Visual regression working
- 🎯 **Milestone 7:** End-to-end integration (NEXT!)
- 🎯 **Milestone 8:** Phase 1 complete (COMING SOON!)

## 📝 Notes & Reminders

### Important Decisions
1. Chose SQLite over PostgreSQL for simplicity
2. Chose Streamlit over React for faster MVP
3. Chose FAISS over Pinecone for local-first approach
4. Chose event bus over direct calls for modularity
5. Chose Playwright over Selenium for better API

### Technical Debt (None Critical)
- Frontend-backend integration (in progress)
- Proper error handling in Streamlit
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Authentication/authorization (Phase 2+)
- Database migrations (Phase 2+)

### Future Considerations
- Consider adding Redis for caching
- Evaluate moving to PostgreSQL for production
- Consider Docker for deployment
- Evaluate adding GraphQL
- Consider microservices for scale
